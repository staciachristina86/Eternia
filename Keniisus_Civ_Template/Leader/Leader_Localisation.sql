	"While Romania's bonuses lend themselves well to diplomatic victories and cultural progression, Vlad will instead look to exploit the war-based bonuses to conquer. With the ability to flip nearby cities upon capturing another, enemies of Vlad will soon find that they are fighting battles on multiple fronts when their cities revolt. Vlad will look to incite chaos wherever he goes, and nothing epitomises this more than his ability to scorch the earth and damage adjacent enemy units when he pillages a tile in enemy territory. With Romania's bonuses for participating in emergencies, Vlad will no doubt find himself the target of many, but Vlad has a strong weapon with his unique horse archer that may move after attacking with which to help him secure a victory, after which he will only become stronger."	),

	"Vlad the Impaler, in full Vlad III Dracula or Romanian Vlad III Dr?culea, also called Vlad III or Romanian Vlad ?epe?, (born 1431, Sighi?oara, Transylvania [now in Romania]—died 1476, north of present-day Bucharest, Romania), voivode (military governor, or prince) of Walachia (1448; 1456–1462; 1476) whose cruel methods of punishing his enemies gained notoriety in 15th-century Europe."),
	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_KENI_HARALD_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2",
	"Vlad was the second of four brothers born into the noble family of Vlad II Dracul. His sobriquet Dracula (meaning “son of Dracul”) was derived from the Latin draco (“dragon”) after his father’s induction into the Order of the Dragon, created by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund for the defense of Christian Europe against the Ottoman Empire. Vlad moved to Târgovi?te, Walachia, in 1436 when his father assumed leadership of the Walachian voivodate (principality). In 1442 Vlad and his younger brother were sent to the court of Ottoman Sultan Murad II as collateral to assure the sultan that their father, in a reversal of his previous position, would support Ottoman policies. Vlad returned in 1448, having been informed of the assassination of his father and older brother at the hands of Walachian boyars (nobles) the year before."),
	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_KENI_HARALD_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3",
	"Vlad then embarked upon the first of a lifelong series of campaigns to regain his father’s seat. His opponents included the boyars as well as his younger brother, who was supported by the Ottoman sultan. He emerged briefly victorious in 1448 but was deposed after only two months. After an eight-year struggle, Vlad again claimed the voivodate."),
	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_KENI_HARALD_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4",
	"It was during this period of rule that he committed the atrocities for which he was best known. His penchant for impaling his enemies on stakes in the ground and leaving them to die earned him the name Vlad the Impaler (Romanian: Vlad ?epe?). He inflicted this type of torture on foreign and domestic enemies alike: notably, as he retreated from a battle in 1462, he left a field filled with thousands of impaled victims as a deterrent to pursuing Ottoman forces. That year he escaped Ottoman capture only to be intercepted by Hungarian forces and imprisoned by Matthias I of Hungary. Vlad regained his seat in 1476 but was killed in battle the same year. He remained a folk hero in the region for his efforts against Ottoman encroachment."),

	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_KENI_HARALD_UU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1",  	
	"In the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the Wallachians relied on light cavalry archers (C?l?ra?i) to deploy hit-and-run tactics. A core component of Vlad's army, C?l?ra?i were lightly armed missile troops typically used in skirmishes, capable of moving swiftly to avoid close combat or to deliver a rapid blow to the flanks or rear of its foe."	);
